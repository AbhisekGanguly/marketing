## Content Pillars (Month 1 mix)

| Pillar | % of feed | Purpose |

| Behind-the-scenes / process | 15% | Transparency, trust |
| Proof / soft promo | 10% | Credibility without selling |

---

## Week 1 — Establish authority & worldview

*Theme: Who we are and what we believe. Set the “we don’t do chaos, we do systems” position.*

### Feed posts

| Day | Format | Topic | Hook / angle | Caption note |
|-----|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Mon | **Reel** | Why most “growth” feels chaotic | “Doing everything isn’t a flex. It’s a sign nothing’s wired together.” → Problem (fragmented tools, no clarity) → What actually fixes it (structure, one source of truth). | Keep under 45s. CTA: Save or Follow for more on systems. |
| Wed | **Carousel** | 5 beliefs we don’t compromise on | Slide 1: “5 things we won’t do for clients.” Slides 2–6: One belief each (e.g. “We won’t do marketing in isolation,” “We won’t replace what works with AI hype,” “You get the core team, not account managers”). | Clean type on solid or subtle gradient. Caption: Short intro + “Which one resonates?” |
| Fri | **Reel** | One “why it failed” breakdown | Pick one: website, funnel, or ads. “This is why [X] fails for most teams.” → 3 reasons (clear, calm, no blame) → What to do instead. | Use a simple framework from your audits/SOPs. |

### Stories (daily, batch 2–3 at a time)

- **Mon:** “What we do in one sentence” (text + your logo).
- **Tue:** Poll: “Growth feeling chaotic or predictable right now?” (Chaotic / Getting clearer)
- **Wed:** Carousel reshare + “Swipe for the 5 beliefs we run on.”
- **Thu:** Question sticker: “What’s the one thing you wish was more structured in your business?”
- **Fri:** BTS: “How we start every client engagement” (one slide: discovery → clarity → system).

---

## Week 2 — Digital clarity (web, funnels, analytics)

*Theme: You help them see clearly. Problem → clarity → solution.*

### Feed posts

| Day | Format | Topic | Hook / angle | Caption note |
|-----|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Mon | **Carousel** | Why your website doesn’t convert (and it’s not “more traffic”) | Slide 1: “Your site has traffic. Still no leads. Here’s why.” Slides 2–8: 3–4 real reasons (messaging, path, trust, speed) + what to fix. Slide 9: One next step. | Pull from audit thinking. Short bullets per slide. |
| Wed | **Reel** | The one metric that actually tells you if marketing works | Talking head: “Most teams track activity. We track [e.g. cost per outcome / pipeline attribution]. Here’s why.” 30–45s. | No jargon dump. One idea, one metric, one “so what.” |
| Fri | **Carousel** | How to know what’s driving ROI (without drowning in data) | “You don’t need more dashboards. You need one clear line from spend → outcome.” 5–7 slides: the funnel view, what to tag, what to ignore, one decision rule. | Reuse from proposals/frameworks. |

### Stories

- **Mon:** “This week = digital clarity. What’s the one number you wish you could trust?”
- **Tue:** Tip card: “First thing we check on every website audit: [one thing].”
- **Wed:** Reshare carousel + “Slide 3 is the one most people skip. Don’t.”
- **Thu:** BTS: Screenshot of a simple framework (blur if needed) — “How we map clarity for clients.”
- **Fri:** Poll: “Biggest data headache: Too many tools / No clear ROI / Don’t know what to fix first?”

---

## Week 3 — Founder decisions & sustainable growth

*Theme: You understand the person in the seat. Decisions, tradeoffs, sustainable pace.*

### Feed posts

| Day | Format | Topic | Hook / angle | Caption note |
|-----|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Mon | **Reel** | The decision that changed how we work with founders | “We used to [common approach]. We stopped. Here’s what we do instead.” Personal, calm, 30–40s. | Behind-the-scenes belief → what you do now. Builds trust. |
| Wed | **Carousel** | 4 growth “levers” that actually move the needle (when they’re connected) | Slide 1: “Growth isn’t one tactic. It’s 4 levers, aligned.” Slides 2–5: Web, automation, ads, content (one each: what it does, when it fails alone, how it fits the system). Slide 6: “Aligned > more.” | Systems view, not tactic soup. |
| Fri | **Reel** | Unpopular opinion: Sustainable growth | “Unpopular opinion: Slow and clear beats fast and chaotic.” Why (retention, decisions, team), in 30s. | Contrarian but reasonable. Invite “agree or disagree?” in caption. |

### Stories

- **Mon:** “Week 3 = decisions and sustainable growth. What’s one decision you keep putting off?”
- **Tue:** Quote card (your words): “We don’t do marketing in isolation. We engineer growth systems.”
- **Wed:** Reshare carousel + “Which lever are you underusing?”
- **Thu:** Question: “What would ‘predictable growth’ actually look like for you?”
- **Fri:** BTS: “How we say no to scope creep” or “How we prioritize what to fix first” (one principle).

---

## Week 4 — Proof, process & next step

*Theme: Show how you work. Soft proof. Clear, low-pressure CTA.*

### Feed posts

| Day | Format | Topic | Hook / angle | Caption note |
|-----|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Mon | **Carousel** | How we run a first engagement (no vague “we do strategy”) | Slide 1: “What actually happens when we start with a client.” Slides 2–7: Discovery → clarity doc → priorities → execution (one slide per phase, 1–2 sentences). Slide 8: “You get the core team. No account manager middle layer.” | Transparency = trust. Reuse from proposals/SOPs. |
| Wed | **Reel** | One thing we fixed that changed results (anonymized) | “We had a client who [vague setup]. The fix wasn’t more ads. It was [one structural thing]. Here’s what we did.” No names, no numbers if you prefer — focus on the *type* of fix. | Proof of thinking, not bragging. |
| Fri | **Carousel** | When it makes sense to work with us (and when it doesn’t) | Slide 1: “We’re not for everyone.” Slides 2–4: Good fit (e.g. already revenue, want structure, want direct access). Slides 5–6: Not yet / wrong fit. Slide 7: “If this is you → [link in bio or DM].” | Qualifying = more authority. Reduces wrong leads. |

### Stories

- **Mon:** “This week we’re pulling back the curtain. What would you want to see?”
- **Tue:** “How we start” — one slide from Monday’s carousel.
- **Wed:** Reshare Reel + “The fix was [one line]. Full story in the Reel.”
- **Thu:** Soft CTA: “If you’re at a growth ceiling and want clarity, not more chaos — link in bio or DM ‘systems’.”
- **Fri:** Month-1 recap: “4 weeks of: authority, clarity, decisions, process. What was most useful? (Reply or comment.)”

---

## Hooks & copy bank (reusable)

**Curiosity**
- “The real reason [websites/ads/funnels] fail isn’t what you think.”
- “We stopped [common practice]. Here’s what we do instead.”

**Value**
- “How to [get clarity / know what’s driving ROI] without [drowning in data / another agency].”
- “X things we won’t do for clients — and why.”

**Contrarian (calm)**
- “Doing everything isn’t a flex.”
- “Unpopular opinion: Slow and clear beats fast and chaotic.”
- “[Common advice] is wrong. Here’s why.”

**Story**
- “One decision that changed how we work with founders.”
- “We had a client who [vague]. The fix wasn’t [obvious]. It was [structural].”

## Batching checklist (5–8 hrs/week)

**Batch 1 (e.g. Sunday or Monday)**  
- [ ] Choose exact topics for the week from the table.  
- [ ] Use Reel scripts in `content/instagram-reel-scripts-month-1.md` (hooks, beats, CTAs).  
- [ ] Use carousel copy in `content/instagram-carousel-content-month-1.md` (all slides + captions).  
- [ ] Pull Story prompts from `content/instagram-stories-strategy-and-ideas.md`.  
- [ ] Brief designer on carousel style (clean, minimal, on-brand).

**Batch 2 (e.g. midweek)**  
- [ ] Record 2 Reels in one sit (same setup, same lighting), using the scripts file.  
- [ ] Build 2 carousels (or hand off to designer) using the carousel copy file.  
- [ ] Schedule Stories from the ideas bank.  
- [ ] Write captions and pick first comment (e.g. “Link in bio” if needed).

**Ongoing**  
- [ ] Schedule feed posts (e.g. Later, Buffer, or native).  
- [ ] Add Stories in small batches (2–3 days at a time); keep polls/questions fresh.  
- [ ] 15 min/day: reply to comments, answer DMs, comment on 3–5 target accounts.

## Repurposing map (from your existing assets)

| Asset | Becomes |
|-------|--------|
| Internal SOPs | Carousel: “How we start every engagement” / “How we prioritize” |
| Strategy frameworks | Carousels: “4 levers,” “What’s driving ROI,” “When we’re a fit” |
| Client thinking (anonymized) | Reels: “One thing we fixed,” “Why it failed” |
| Decks / proposals | Carousel slides, Reel talking points |
| Past reels on ads, funnels, structure | Reshare with new caption or trim into Stories |

---

## Success signals (Month 1)

- **Authority:** Saves and shares on “why it fails” and “how we think” content.  
- **Trust:** DMs or comments asking “how do you do X?” or “when are you a fit?”  
- **Reach:** Reels outpace static posts; one or two carousels get solid saves.  

Track: which hooks get watch time, which carousels get saves, which Story prompts get replies. Double down in Month 2.
