## Reel 1 — Week 1 Mon: Why most “growth” feels chaotic

**Intent:** Call out chaotic growth, position “systems & clarity” as the fix, invite inquiries from founders at a ceiling.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “Stop adding more marketing. You’re making it worse.”
- “If your growth feels chaotic, this is probably why.”
- “The busier your marketing looks, the less it’s probably working.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “Most founders we meet aren’t short on activity. They’re drowning in it. Ads here, a funnel there, three different agencies… and no one can answer a simple question: *what’s actually working?*”
- **Value (core points):**
  - Point 1: **Fragmented tools & vendors** — each channel optimised in isolation, no shared source of truth.  
  - Point 2: **No owner for the system** — everyone owns a tactic, nobody owns the entire growth engine.  
  - Point 3: **No single definition of success** — ten metrics, zero decisions. Reporting becomes theatre instead of guidance.
  - Bridge: “So it feels like growth… but you can’t predict next month, and you can’t repeat what worked.”
  - Fix (high level): “The shift is simple, but not easy: one owner, one system, one source of truth. You wire your website, automation, ads, and content into a single, boring, reliable growth machine.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “If this sounds uncomfortably familiar, you don’t need another random tactic.”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM us the word **‘systems’** and we’ll send you the one‑page outline we use before we touch anyone’s marketing.”  
- “If you’re at a ceiling and want growth to feel *predictable* instead of chaotic, hit the link in our bio and see exactly how we work with founders.”  
- “Comment **‘clarity’** and I’ll reply with the 3 questions we ask before changing anything in a growth system.”

### First comment
“Link in bio → how we build growth systems for founders, not more noise. Or DM **‘systems’** and we’ll send you the one‑pager we start every engagement with.”

## Reel 2 — Week 1 Fri: One “why it failed” breakdown (site / funnel / ads)

**Intent:** Show how you think, not just that something “didn’t work”. Make failure feel safe to talk about and position structural fixes.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “Your [website / funnel / ads] is failing for one of these 3 reasons. Most teams fix the wrong one.”
- “Before you rebuild your funnel, check this.”
- “It’s almost never the ad creative. It’s the system behind it.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “When something isn’t converting, the default reaction is ‘new agency, new funnel, new website’. In most cases, that’s the most expensive way to avoid the real problem.”
- **Value (example breakdown):**
  - Brief anonymised context: “We worked with a team spending steadily on ads, getting clicks, but pipeline was flat.”
  - Reason 1 — **Wrong promise:** What the ad said didn’t match what the landing page and product actually delivered, so people dropped off.  
  - Reason 2 — **Broken path:** No clear next step. People had to think too hard about what to do.  
  - Reason 3 — **No follow‑up system:** If they didn’t buy immediately, they disappeared. No nurture, no automation.
  - “Most teams react by changing creative every week. We changed the underlying system: tightened the promise, simplified the path to one clear action, and built follow‑up that didn’t depend on someone remembering to send an email.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “So before you fire your agency or kill a channel…”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM **‘audit’** and I’ll send you the exact 3 checks we run before we let anyone touch a funnel.”  
- “If you have a channel that ‘should’ be working but isn’t, tap the link in bio and see how we do low‑drama audits before we recommend changes.”  
- “Comment **‘funnel’** and I’ll reply with one question you can ask your team this week to know where the real leak is.”

### First comment
“Don’t rebuild blindly. Link in bio for how we audit growth systems, or DM **‘audit’** and we’ll send the 3 checks we start with.”

## Reel 3 — Week 2 Wed: The one metric that actually tells you if marketing works

**Intent:** Reframe away from vanity metrics and position you as the partner who brings clarity.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “Forget impressions. This is the only number we care about.”
- “If you can’t say this one number, your marketing isn’t actually measurable.”
- “Most reports are designed to impress you, not help you decide. Here’s the fix.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “Most reports we see are walls of numbers: clicks, impressions, CTR, view‑through rate… and yet the founder still can’t answer: ‘Is this actually growing the business?’”
- **Value (core concept):**
  - Introduce your preferred metric (adapt as you like): “We boil everything down to **cost per qualified opportunity** (or your equivalent ‘pipeline’ metric).”
  - Why: “Because that’s the bridge between money out and real conversations in. Everything else is supporting detail.”
  - Simple example: “If Campaign A is cheaper per click but twice as expensive per qualified opportunity, it’s not the better campaign.”
  - Clarify: “We still look at other numbers, but they’re there to explain *why*, not to distract from *what* is happening.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “If your reporting doesn’t give you that one number clearly…”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM **‘metric’** and I’ll send you a simple template we use to track this without building another bloated dashboard.”  
- “If you want your marketing reports to drive decisions instead of arguments, hit the link in our bio and see how we re‑build reporting for clients.”  
- “Comment **‘number’** if you want the 3 questions we ask before we trust any marketing metric.”

### First comment
“One number → clear decisions. Link in bio for how we rebuild reporting around pipeline, or DM **‘metric’** for the simple template.”

## Reel 4 — Week 3 Mon: The decision that changed how we work with founders

**Intent:** Personal, founder‑led story that shows your values and boundaries. Builds respect and trust.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “We used to say yes to almost everything. One client conversation changed that.”
- “The best decision we made wasn’t a tactic. It was a boundary.”
- “We stopped trying to be ‘full service’. Here’s what happened.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “In our early days, we tried to be everything for everyone. If a client asked for it, we’d probably say yes.”
- **Value (story beats):**
  - The moment: “Then we had a founder ask us to add three more channels, change the offer, and rebuild the website — all at once — *without* fixing the underlying system.”
  - Your internal realisation: “We realised we were being hired as activity suppliers, not as partners in building a growth system.”
  - The decision: “So we made a rule: we only engage where we can own or influence the system — website, automation, analytics, and the key growth levers — not random one‑off tasks in a broken setup.”
  - Outcome: “Since then, projects are calmer, results are clearer, and founders know exactly what we’re responsible for.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “If you feel like you’re managing five different vendors who all own a piece but not the whole…”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM **‘partner’** and I’ll send you the checklist we use to decide whether we’re the right fit — you can use it on any vendor.”  
- “If you want fewer vendors and more ownership, there’s a breakdown of how we work with founders at the link in our bio.”  
- “Comment **‘ownership’** and I’ll reply with one question you can ask every agency you work with.”

### First comment
“We’re not in the business of selling random tasks. Link in bio for how we partner with founders, or DM **‘partner’** for the fit‑checklist we use internally.”

## Reel 5 — Week 3 Fri: Unpopular opinion — sustainable growth

**Intent:** Contrarian but grounded take that attracts founders who care about predictability, not hype.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “Unpopular opinion: If your growth isn’t predictable, it’s not growth. It’s luck.”
- “Everyone celebrates spikes. We care about the boring line that keeps going up.”
- “Fast and chaotic looks exciting… right up until payroll is due.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “Social makes it look like growth is a series of overnight spikes and ‘we tried this one trick’ stories.”
- **Value (core argument):**
  - Point 1: “Spikes feel great, but they’re hard to staff for, hard to fulfil, and impossible to forecast.”  
  - Point 2: “What actually builds a calm company is growth you can explain and repeat: you know why last month worked, and what happens if you double down.”  
  - Point 3: “That comes from systems — clear offers, clean paths, consistent measurement — not random experiments stacked on top of each other.”
  - Close: “Slow and clear beats fast and chaotic, every time, if you care about the next 3–5 years, not the next 3–5 weeks.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “If you’re done chasing spikes and want a growth engine you can actually plan around…”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM **‘steady’** and I’ll send you the 4 levers we look at first when we’re building sustainable growth.”  
- “There’s a breakdown of how we design for predictability, not just speed, at the link in our bio.”  
- “Comment **‘sustainable’** if you want the question we ask founders before we touch budget.”

### First comment
“Predictable > viral. Link in bio for how we design for steady growth, or DM **‘steady’** for the 4‑lever checklist.”

## Reel 6 — Week 4 Wed: One thing we fixed that changed results (anonymised)

**Intent:** Show a concrete, anonymised win that proves your thinking and systems approach, without bragging or sharing sensitive details.

### Hook options
- **[Recommended]** “They kept increasing ad spend. Results got worse. The fix had nothing to do with ads.”
- “Sometimes the lever isn’t where you’re spending the money.”
- “Before you blame the channel, check this.”

### Script beats
- **Setup:**  
  “We had a client who’d been told their problem was ‘more budget’. Every time numbers dipped, they spent more. It worked for a while… until it didn’t.”
- **Value (story + fix):**
  - Context: “On paper, everything looked fine — good CTR, decent CPL — but revenue wasn’t moving with spend.”
  - Diagnosis: “When we mapped the full journey, we realised the real drop‑off was **after** the lead: slow response times, no clear follow‑up, no automation, no prioritisation.”
  - Fix: “We left the ad spend where it was and rebuilt the system behind it: clearer qualification, faster routing, simple automation, and a tighter handover to sales.”
  - Result (qualitative, no hype): “Same budget. Fewer leads. More pipeline. Because the system was finally set up to handle the attention they were already buying.”
- **CTA transition:**  
  “So before you throw more money at the top of the funnel…”

### CTA options
- **[Recommended]** “DM **‘fix’** and I’ll send you the 5‑step checklist we use to find bottlenecks *after* the click.”  
- “If you suspect the problem isn’t your ads, there’s a breakdown of how we look at systems, not just channels, at the link in our bio.”  
- “Comment **‘bottleneck’** and I’ll reply with one place to look this week before you increase budget.”

### First comment
“Don’t pay for more traffic into a broken system. Link in bio for how we diagnose bottlenecks, or DM **‘fix’** for the 5‑step checklist.”
