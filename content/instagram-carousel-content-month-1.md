## Carousel 1 — Week 1 Wed: 5 beliefs we don’t compromise on

**Intent:** Establish worldview and boundaries. Signal “we’re not a generic agency.”  
**Slides:** 6

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “5 things we won’t do for clients”
- **Subline:** “If you want chaos, we’re not the right team.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “1. We won’t do marketing in isolation”
- **Body:** “Ads, websites, automation, analytics — they only work when they’re wired into one system. We don’t optimise random pieces in a broken machine.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “2. We won’t replace what’s already working”
- **Body:** “If a channel or system is performing, we double down and systemise it. We don’t rip it out just to make room for shiny new tools.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “3. We won’t sell ‘more activity’ as a result”
- **Body:** “Busy dashboards don’t pay salaries. We focus on predictable outcomes — not vanity metrics or endless campaigns with no clear ROI.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “4. We won’t hide you behind account managers”
- **Body:** “You work directly with the people designing your growth system. No telephone game, no fluffy status updates.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “5. We won’t chase trends with no depth”
- **Body:** “No get‑rich‑quick promises, no ‘AI will replace everything’ fear‑bait. Just clear thinking, systems, and long‑term alignment.”

### Suggested caption
“We’re not the right fit for every business — and that’s the point.  
If you want structured, sustainable growth instead of constant chaos, these are the lines we don’t cross.  
\nWhich belief hits home the most for you?”

## Carousel 2 — Week 2 Mon: Why your website doesn’t convert (and it’s not “more traffic”)

**Intent:** Reframe the website as part of a system and show 3–4 core failure points you fix.  
**Slides:** 9

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “Your site has traffic. Still no leads. Here’s why.”
- **Subline:** “It’s rarely a ‘more traffic’ problem.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “Reason 1: The message isn’t clear”
- **Body:** “If a founder can’t say what you do in one sentence, your visitors definitely can’t. Confused people don’t convert — they close the tab.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “Fix it”
- **Body:** “Lead with who you help, the problem you solve, and the outcome you create. One clear promise, above the fold.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “Reason 2: There’s no obvious next step”
- **Body:** “Multiple buttons, competing CTAs, or a menu full of options forces visitors to think too hard. Most won’t.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “Fix it”
- **Body:** “Give them one primary path. One main action you want them to take, repeated consistently down the page.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “Reason 3: The page doesn’t build enough trust”
- **Body:** “Logos, proof, process, and people are missing or buried. Visitors don’t see why they should trust you over the 10 other tabs they have open.”

### Slide 7
- **Headline:** “Fix it”
- **Body:** “Show proof early. Add concise social proof, a simple ‘how we work’ snapshot, and real faces behind the brand.”

### Slide 8
- **Headline:** “Reason 4: It doesn’t match the rest of your system”
- **Body:** “Ads say one thing, the site says another, the form hands off to nowhere. Even good traffic falls through the gaps.”

### Slide 9
- **Headline:** “Your next step”
- **Body:** “Before you pay for more visitors, fix the message, the path, the proof, and the handover. More traffic into a broken system just gives you more waste.”

### Suggested caption
“Most ‘website problems’ aren’t traffic problems.  
They’re clarity, trust, and system problems.\n\nIf your site has visitors but not leads, start with these four checks before you touch your ad budget.  
Save this for your next review.”

## Carousel 3 — Week 2 Fri: How to know what’s driving ROI (without drowning in data)

**Intent:** Show your structured view on measurement. Make clarity feel achievable, not overwhelming.  
**Slides:** 6–7

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “You don’t need more dashboards.”
- **Subline:** “You need one clear line from spend → outcome.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “Step 1: Define the outcome that matters”
- **Body:** “Pick one primary outcome that actually moves the business — qualified opportunities, demos held, proposals sent, or similar. Everything points to this.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “Step 2: Map the simple funnel”
- **Body:** “From spend → click → lead → qualified → outcome. No extra stages yet. Just the key steps where money or intent can leak.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “Step 3: Decide what to tag (and what to ignore)”
- **Body:** “Tag the essentials: source, campaign, keyword or audience, and key actions. Ignore 90% of vanity metrics that don’t change decisions.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “Step 4: Ask one question”
- **Body:** “For each channel: ‘What’s our cost per qualified opportunity?’ If you can’t answer, you don’t have real attribution — just activity.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “Step 5: Make a decision”
- **Body:** “Shift budget from channels with high cost per outcome to those with lower cost *and* room to scale. Then repeat calmly, every month.”

### (Optional) Slide 7
- **Headline:** “Clarity beats complexity”
- **Body:** “A simple, honest funnel you actually use is worth more than a perfect dashboard nobody trusts.”

### Suggested caption
“More data isn’t the goal. Better decisions are.  
\nIf your reports don’t tell you which levers are actually driving ROI, simplify the system first.  
Start with one outcome, one funnel, one key question: ‘What’s our cost per qualified opportunity?’”

## Carousel 4 — Week 3 Wed: 4 growth levers (when they’re connected)

**Intent:** Show your systems view of growth. Make it clear you don’t optimise channels in isolation.  
**Slides:** 6

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “Growth isn’t one tactic. It’s 4 levers, aligned.”
- **Subline:** “When they’re disconnected, everything feels harder.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “Lever 1: Website & landing pages”
- **Body:** “Where the promise lives. When this fails alone: you drive traffic to a page that confuses or stalls people. Clicks in, nothing out.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “Lever 2: Automation & follow‑up”
- **Body:** “Where consistency lives. When this fails alone: leads vanish after the first form fill. No structured nurture, no clear handover.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “Lever 3: Paid & organic acquisition”
- **Body:** “Where attention comes from. When this fails alone: spikes of traffic with no system behind them. You can’t repeat what worked.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “Lever 4: Content & education”
- **Body:** “Where trust is built. When this fails alone: people know you exist, but don’t understand why you’re different — so they don’t reach out.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “Aligned > more”
- **Body:** “Most teams try to pull harder on one lever. We align all four so the whole system moves together. That’s how growth becomes predictable.”

### Suggested caption
“If your growth feels fragile, it’s usually because one lever is doing all the work.  
\nYou don’t need 20 more tactics. You need four levers, wired into one system.\n\nWhich lever feels weakest for you right now?”

## Carousel 5 — Week 4 Mon: How we run a first engagement

**Intent:** Pull back the curtain on your process. Reduce risk in the buyer’s mind and show structure.  
**Slides:** 8

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “What actually happens when we start with a client”
- **Subline:** “No vague ‘strategy sessions’. A clear, structured process.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “Phase 1: Discovery”
- **Body:** “We learn how your business really works — offers, customers, numbers, constraints. No templates, no assumptions.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “Phase 2: Clarity doc”
- **Body:** “We map your current systems, gaps, and opportunities into a simple clarity document everyone can understand.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “Phase 3: Priorities”
- **Body:** “Together, we pick the few moves that will actually matter in the next 90 days. No 40‑item wishlists that never get done.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “Phase 4: Architecture”
- **Body:** “We design or refine the underlying system — website, automation, analytics, and growth levers — so everything pulls in the same direction.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “Phase 5: Execution”
- **Body:** “We implement the plan with you. Clean builds, clear ownership, and communication that doesn’t require translation.”

### Slide 7
- **Headline:** “Phase 6: Review & adjust”
- **Body:** “We look at what’s working, what isn’t, and what’s next — using data and context, not just hunches.”

### Slide 8
- **Headline:** “You get the core team — not account managers”
- **Body:** “You work directly with the people thinking about your systems. That’s how we keep projects focused, honest, and effective.”

### Suggested caption
“‘What does working together actually look like?’ shouldn’t be a mystery.  
\nThis is the structure we bring into every first engagement — so you know exactly what’s happening, and why.\n\nIf you’re at a growth ceiling and want clarity instead of more noise, the link in our bio walks through this in more detail.”

## Carousel 6 — Week 4 Fri: When it makes sense to work with us (and when it doesn’t)

**Intent:** Qualify fit. Build authority by being honest about who you’re for.  
**Slides:** 7

### Slide 1
- **Headline:** “We’re not for everyone.”
- **Subline:** “Here’s when it makes sense to work together — and when it doesn’t.”

### Slide 2
- **Headline:** “Good fit: You’re already generating revenue”
- **Body:** “You’ve proven there’s demand. You’re not looking for a miracle — you’re looking for structure so growth stops feeling accidental.”

### Slide 3
- **Headline:** “Good fit: You want clarity, not more chaos”
- **Body:** “You’re tired of disconnected tools, agencies, and reports. You want one system and one team who can explain what’s actually driving ROI.”

### Slide 4
- **Headline:** “Good fit: You value direct access”
- **Body:** “You want to work with the people thinking about your growth, not just account managers relaying messages.”

### Slide 5
- **Headline:** “Not yet: You’re pre‑revenue or still testing the idea”
- **Body:** “If you’re still proving there’s a market, you don’t need complex systems yet. Simple experiments beat heavy infrastructure.”

### Slide 6
- **Headline:** “Wrong fit: You want ‘hacks’ and quick wins”
- **Body:** “If you’re chasing overnight results or the latest trick, we’ll frustrate each other. We build systems designed to work for years, not weeks.”

### Slide 7
- **Headline:** “If this sounds like you…”
- **Body:** “You’re at a growth ceiling. You want structure, clarity, and a calm partner. That’s where we do our best work.”

### Suggested caption
“Saying ‘no’ clearly is part of building the right ‘yes’.  
\nIf these ‘good fit’ boxes describe you, and you’re ready to turn scattered efforts into a structured growth system, you can learn more about how we work at the link in our bio.\n\nIf not, save this for later — we’ll still be here when the timing is right.”
