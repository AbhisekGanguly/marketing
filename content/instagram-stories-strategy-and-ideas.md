# Instagram Stories — Strategy & Idea Bank (Ganguly Consulting)

Voice: **calm, clear, founder‑led**. Authority without hype.

Stories keep you **top of mind**, deepen trust, and create low‑friction paths to DMs and profile visits.

---

## Part A — Stories Strategy (Month 1)

### 1. Goals

- Stay near the top of followers’ feeds consistently.
- Show the *real* thinking and process behind your work.
- Test what resonates (polls, questions) to shape future content.
- Open low‑pressure doors into DMs and your profile (link in bio).

### 2. Cadence & batching

- Aim for **3–7 Story frames per day**, most days.
- Batch 2–3 days at a time so you’re not creating from scratch daily.
- Use formats that are quick to produce: polls, question stickers, screenshots, simple text cards, short selfie videos.

### 3. When to use which format

- **Polls / binary choices**
  - Use when you want fast, low‑effort responses.
  - Great for: “chaotic vs predictable”, “which lever”, “biggest headache”.
  - Use early in the week to gather insight for later content.

- **Question stickers**
  - Use when you’re ready to read and respond thoughtfully.
  - Great for: “what do you wish was more structured”, “what would predictable growth look like”, “what would you want to see behind the scenes”.
  - Follow up by sharing a few answers (anonymised if needed) with your comments.

- **BTS / process**
  - Use to show how you actually think and work.
  - Great for: “how we start every client engagement”, “first thing we check on every audit”, “how we say no to scope creep”, “how we prioritise”.
  - A single slide with 1–2 lines of text over a simple photo is enough.

- **Reshare (feed posts)**
  - After every Reel or carousel, add **1–2 Story frames**:
    - Frame 1: teaser line (“The fix wasn’t more ads.”)
    - Frame 2: reshare of the post with a short nudge (“Tap to watch” / “Slide 3 is the one most people skip.”)

- **Tip / quote cards**
  - Use to reinforce key ideas from your feed content.
  - Short text on a branded background. No generic motivational quotes — only your thinking.

- **Soft CTAs**
  - Use sparingly (roughly **once per week**).
  - E.g. “If you’re at a growth ceiling and want clarity, not more chaos — link in bio or DM ‘systems’.”

### 4. Best times & rhythm

- Aim to have at least a few Stories live across **11am–1pm** and **7–9pm**.
- When you post a Reel or carousel, pair it with a Story tease within the next hour.
- Don’t stress about perfect timing — consistency and quality matter more.

### 5. What to avoid

- Generic quotes that could come from any agency.
- Over‑selling in every Story frame.
- Asking questions and then ignoring the replies.
- Over‑complicating design; simple, clean frames win.

## Part B — Story Ideas Bank

Pick from these ideas any day of the month. You don’t have to follow the calendar exactly.

### 1. Poll ideas (5–8)

Use a simple two‑option or multi‑option poll.

1. **“Growth right now:”**  
   - Option A: Chaotic  
   - Option B: Getting clearer
2. **“Biggest data headache:”**  
   - Option A: Too many tools  
   - Option B: No clear ROI  
   - Option C: Don’t know what to fix first
3. **“Which lever feels weakest?”**  
   - Option A: Website / landing pages  
   - Option B: Automation / follow‑up  
   - Option C: Ads / acquisition  
   - Option D: Content / education
4. **“Do you have a single ‘source of truth’ for your numbers?”**  
   - Option A: Yes  
   - Option B: Not really
5. **“How does marketing feel in your business?”**  
   - Option A: Structured  
   - Option B: Reactive  
   - Option C: Depends on the week

You can reuse these multiple times across the month — the answers will change as your audience grows.

### 2. Question sticker ideas (5–8)

Use the question sticker when you’re able to reply or share a few responses.

1. “What’s the **one thing** you wish was more structured in your business right now?”
2. “When you hear ‘predictable growth’, what does that actually look like in your world?”
3. “What’s one decision about your website / funnels / ads you keep putting off?”
4. “If we broke down one system live on Stories, what would you want to see us unpack?”
5. “What’s the most confusing part of your current marketing reports?”
6. “What would you want to see behind the scenes of an audit or engagement?”

### 3. BTS / process ideas (5–8)

Pair a quick photo or screen snippet with 1–2 lines of text.

1. **“How we start every client engagement”**  
   One slide showing: “Discovery → clarity doc → priorities → execution”.
2. **“First thing we check on every website audit”**  
   E.g. “Can a stranger understand who you help and what you do in 5 seconds?”
3. **“How we map clarity for clients”**  
   Blurred screenshot of a simple diagram or doc + one line: “We turn chaos into one clear picture first.”
4. **“How we say no to scope creep”**  
   Short line: “If it doesn’t serve the agreed outcomes, it goes on the later list.”
5. **“How we prioritise what to fix first”**  
   E.g. “We start where impact is high and implementation risk is low.”
6. **“What actually happens in our weekly internal review”**  
   One or two bullets: “Review active systems → spot bottlenecks → pick one improvement.”

### 4. Reshare + tease templates

Use these when you share your own feed posts to Stories.

- **For a ‘why it failed’ Reel or carousel:**  
  Text overlay: “The fix wasn’t more ads. Tap to see what actually changed.”
- **For a clarity / metrics post:**  
  Text overlay: “If your reports don’t answer this one question, start here. ⬆️”
- **For a process / ‘how we work’ post:**  
  Text overlay: “If you’ve ever wondered what working with us looks like, start with this.”
- **For a ‘fit’ carousel:**  
  Text overlay: “We’re not for everyone. This post explains exactly who we do our best work with.”

### 5. Tip / quote card ideas (5–8)

Short, opinionated lines in your voice.

1. “We don’t do marketing in isolation. We engineer growth systems.”
2. “You don’t need more dashboards. You need one clear line from spend to outcome.”
3. “Doing everything isn’t a flex. It’s a sign nothing’s wired together.”
4. “Predictable > viral. Spikes are fun. Systems pay salaries.”
5. “Aligned > more. Four levers working together beat 40 disconnected tactics.”
6. “Most ‘marketing problems’ are system problems in disguise.”

### 6. Soft CTA ideas (2–3)

Use occasionally, ideally after you’ve shared value or insight.

1. “If you’re at a growth ceiling and want clarity, not more chaos — the link in our bio walks through how we work with founders.”  
2. “DM us **‘systems’** if you want the one‑pager we use to map a calm, predictable growth engine.”  
3. “If your tools, agencies, and reports all feel disconnected, we can help you wire them into one system. Details at the link in bio.”

## Optional — Mapping ideas to the Month 1 calendar

You can keep things loose, but if you want a simple structure, you can map the idea bank to the existing calendar like this:

| Week | Mon focus                  | Mid‑week focus                    | Fri focus                     |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Poll + BTS (“what we do”) | Reshare beliefs carousel + quote  | BTS (“how we start”)         |
| 2    | Poll on numbers           | Question about reports / metrics  | Reshare clarity content      |
| 3    | Question on decisions     | Reshare 4‑lever carousel + poll   | BTS on prioritising changes  |
| 4    | Question on ‘what to see’ | Reshare proof Reel + BTS snippet  | Soft CTA + month recap       |

Treat this as a suggestion, not a rule. The core idea:  
**Most days = 1–2 quick frames from the idea bank, plus reshares when you publish Reels or carousels.**
